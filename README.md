# Affirmations

This application was made as part of google's kotlin course.

Affirmations is an app that displays 10 affirmations with image for each of them.
The affirmations are stacked on each other, and the screen is scrollable.

In this application I performed:
1. Wroking with recycler view
2. Adding items to recycler view from other xml
3. Working with pakcages
4. Configuring adapter and view holder
5. Changing theme and icon for app
6. Instrumentation testing and unit testing
7. Configuring dependecies in gradle config file
8.
